## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Process Monitor Engine**
   - Uses `psutil` library for cross-platform process information
   - Gathers PID, name, memory usage, CPU usage, and status
   - Implements efficient data collection with error handling

2. **GUI Framework**
   - Built with `tkinter` for native look and feel
   - Sortable table with `ttk.Treeview`
   - Responsive design with proper grid layout

3. **Memory Management**
   - Real-time memory tracking in MB
   - Total system memory calculation
   - Memory usage sorting and filtering

4. **Process Control**
   - Safe process termination with confirmation dialogs
   - Platform-specific signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
   - Error handling for access denied scenarios

### Key Features

| Feature | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Real-time Monitoring** | Updates every 3 seconds | Threading with `time.sleep()` |
| **Memory Sorting** | Sort by memory usage (descending) | Custom sorting algorithm |
| **Process Killing** | Kill processes via GUI or keyboard | `psutil.Process.terminate()` |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Cmd+K (Mac), Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux) | Event binding |
| **Auto-refresh** | Toggle automatic updates | Boolean variable with thread control |
| **Cross-platform** | Works on macOS, Linux, Windows | Platform detection with `platform.system()` |

## üíª Usage Instructions

### Basic Operations

1. **Launch Application:**
   ```bash
   python memview.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Processes:**
   - Processes are automatically loaded and sorted by memory usage
   - Click column headers to sort by different criteria
   - Auto-refresh updates every 3 seconds (toggle with checkbox)

3. **Kill a Process:**
   - **Method 1:** Select process and click "Kill Selected"
   - **Method 2:** Double-click on process row
   - **Method 3:** Use keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K on Mac, Ctrl+K on Windows/Linux)
   - **Method 4:** Use "Kill by PID" for specific process ID

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Win/Linux) | Kill selected process |
| `Cmd+R` (Mac) / `Ctrl+R` (Win/Linux) | Refresh process list |
| `F5` | Refresh process list |
| `Delete` | Kill selected process |
| `Cmd+Q` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Q` (Win/Linux) | Quit application |

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### 1. Process Filtering
The application can be extended with filtering capabilities:
```python
def filter_processes(self, min_memory=0, process_name=""):
    # Filter processes by memory threshold or name
    pass
```

### 2. Memory Graphs
Add real-time memory usage graphs:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg

def create_memory_graph(self):
    # Create real-time memory usage graph
    pass
```

### 3. Process Details
Show detailed process information:
```python
def show_process_details(self, pid):
    # Show detailed process information in popup
    pass
```
